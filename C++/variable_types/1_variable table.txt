


character types 

1. Char - at least 8 bit (1byte)
2. Char16_t - at least 16bit / not smaller than char
3. char32_t - at least 32bit / not smaller than char16_t
4. wchar_t - can represent the largest supported character set (not commonly used)



Integer types (signed) ( -4, -3 ,-2 ....0 ... 1 ,3, 5...)
**can skil signed & int 

1. signed char - at least 8bits(1byte)
2. signed short int - (2BYTE) at least 16bits / not smaller than char
3. signed int - (2BYTE / mostly 4BYTE)   at least 16bits / not smaller than short
4. signed long int - (4BYTE) at least 32bits / not smaller than int
5. signed long long int - (8BYTE) at least 64bits / not smaller than long 



Integer types (unsigned) (0, 1, 3, 5, 6 .....)
**only can skip int

1. unsigned char    
2. unsigned short int
3. unsigned int					/ same as signed 
4. unsigned long int 
5. unsigned long long int 



Floating - Point types 
**Longer -> more percise 

1. float - 4byte // 정밀도 측면에서 float = single precision 
2. double - 8byte-  precision not less than float // = double precision // 
3. long double - precision not less than double  



Boolean type (true or false? )

1. bool



Void type 

1. void - (no storage)


Null Pointer 

1. decltype(nullptr)
